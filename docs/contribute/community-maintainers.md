The following is a list of regular contributors to the Polygon Wiki that include
their contact information.

if one of these people ever contacts you directly, first check the contact 
information to see that it matches the origin of the message, and then feel free 
to get in touch with someone else on this list to verify the legitimacy of the original
inquiry. 

:::warning Employee impersonation is a common type of scam

Always validate the person you are in contact with and see if
their contact information matches the origin of the message.
It is also a good idea to get in touch with someone
